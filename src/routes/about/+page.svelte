        Hello! My Name is Noel John Mateo. My story is that I don't really know what I want to be when I graduate this course.
        I really wanted hardware instead of software because of watching a lot of videos about computer and how it's made.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of my passion, I helped a lot of friends fix their computers and help others where I excel at based from what I know.
        There are times that I wish there are free education for computer engineering because I struggle in learning programming languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        But now I learned that I can still love hardware even though I struggle in learning programming languages, I can still manage to learn it and use it for my future.
      <p>
        My journey as a student who doesn't know what will happen in my future endeavours is that one thing is for sure that no matter what happens, just keep on enjoying learning something new.
